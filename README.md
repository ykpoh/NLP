# NLP
It is a library that I will continuously contribute to help everyone complete Natural Language Processing-related task. Feel free to contribute to this project to help more people solving NLP-related task. 

# MalayTextPredictionSystem
it is an example using the functions in bigram library file to predict the next word user is going to key in based on the sentence that he or she has key in and also the database given. By putting the text file and changing the file name in MalayTextPredictionSystem.py, you can use it for any languages that you want.

*Note: the functions are dedicateed for tweets data, therefore, it reads each line in the given text file through looping. You might want to modify the code if you intend to use it for documents.
